# How to use the JWA Assistant

## Getting Info
This step is meant to be for inputing new dinos and their recipes. To use it correctly, start with the highest rarity dinos, then follow with lower rarities.

## Updating Info
I'm not sure what goes here yet

## Logic
The system will tell you what dinos to make as blue or orange, so use your own judgement if you want to mark a third color. I recommend purple for dinos that you can immediately level up or fuse when you get DNA for them.
